# ByteTrack tuned configuration for V-ICR person tracking
# Optimized for action recognition pipeline with stable person tracking

tracker_type: bytetrack  # (str) Tracker backend: bytetrack

# Thresholds tuned for person detection with high confidence
track_high_thresh: 0.5   # (float) First-stage match threshold; higher for cleaner person tracks
track_low_thresh: 0.1    # (float) Second-stage threshold for low-score matches
new_track_thresh: 0.6    # (float) Start new track threshold; matches conf=0.6 in detector.py

# Buffer tuned for action recognition (handles brief occlusions)
track_buffer: 60         # (int) Frames to keep lost tracks alive; ~2 sec at 30fps

# Association threshold
match_thresh: 0.8        # (float) IoU-based association threshold

# Score fusion for stable detection
fuse_score: True         # (bool) Fuse detection score with IoU for matching
